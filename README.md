Advent of code 2021 solutions in vimscript because apparently I enjoy pain.

The vimscript files for each day assume that you have the input file for each
challenge open with the cursor at the beginning of the file.

To run a given day's solution, use `./run.vim {day}`.

To get started working on a given day, use `./run.vim -s {day}` (downloads
input file and creates template for solution file). Make sure you have stored
your advent of code session cookie in a file called `session_cookie` in this
repository. Don't commit it obviously (it's in the gitignore for a reason).
